Is it enough? Is <a href = 'http://dict.vn' target='_blank'>dict.vn</a> outstanding?<br/><br/>

Let's see. What makes us different?</br></br>

Well, we believe in <b>KISS</b> (<b><u>K</b></u>eep <b><u>I</b></u>t <b><u>S</b></u>imple, <b><u>S</b></u>tupid). Instead of adding as much languages as possible, we concentrate on English and Vietnamese. Our apps will be the bridge between two languages to help Vietnamese people learn, understand and play with English joyfully.<br/><br/>

<b>KISS</b> again. Instead of going for features races, we concentrate on information access and presentation as convenient as possible. We know that you are busy, so Why do you have to select dictionary types, turn on/off Vietnamese input method before you enter any word to lookup? Why you have to look though a lot of examples and idioms before you found the meanings you want to? Can you just double mouse click on the word you want to lookup instead of typing?<br/><br/>

With <a href = 'http://dict.vn' target='_blank'>dict.vn</a>, you just type or click and get the results. No options, no noisy information, friendly and customizable user interface. <br/><br/>

Last but not least, a lot of fun apps on top of the dictionary will be release soon!<br/><br/>

Thanks for using our service!<br/><br/>
